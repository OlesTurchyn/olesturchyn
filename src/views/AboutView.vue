      👋 Hi, my name is Oleksander.

      <br />

      <br />
      💻 I'm driven by solving business problems and creating value through
      data. Through internship experience at Trend Micro, Nokia, and the
      Canadian Federal Government, I've been able to explore my interests while
      helping to make organizational impact.
      <br />

      <br />⛵ Aside from work, I'm interested in photography, dance, skiing,
      research, and sailing.

      <br />

      <br />

      📧 Thanks for stopping by my site! Please don't hesitate to reach out if
      we share any common interests, or if you'd like to work together.
