    <h3>Hi, my name is Oles, and I'm passionate about building software solutions that protect organizations from emerging threats. 
      Whether it's cyber attacks, data breaches, or other security risks, I'd like to help.

      <br>

      <br>
      With internship experience in both the public and private sectors, I've gained a wide range of skills, from threat intelligence research to full-stack web development and IT management. 
      I'm constantly learning and growing, and I'm excited to apply my knowledge to new challenges.
      
      <br>
      
      <br> When I'm not working, I love to explore the world and try new things. Photography, alpine skiing, volleyball, and dance are just a few of my hobbies. 
      And while I'm based in Canada, I'm always up for an adventure.

      <br>

      <br>

      Thanks for stopping by my site! Let's connect and see how we can work together to make the world a safer place.
    </h3>
