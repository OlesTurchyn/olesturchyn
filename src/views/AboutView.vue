    <h3>Hi, my name is Oles and I'm interested in Software Engineering, 
      Cyber Security, and Business Intelligence. I aim to help
      build solutions that can protect organizations and institutions from 
      emerging threats.

      <br>

      <br>
      I have internship experience in both the Public and Private sector where I've 
      worked on threat intelligence research, full-stack web development, and IT Management.
      
      <br>
      
      <br> I'm based in Canada, but love exploring the world and trying new things. 
      Some of my hobbies include photography, alpine skiing, volleyball, and dance. 

      <br>

      <br>

      Thank you for checking out my site!
