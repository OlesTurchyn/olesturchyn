    <h3>Hi, my name is Oleksander, but more personably, you can call me Oles. 

      <br>

      <br>
      I'm interested in building solutions that can protect organizations from emerging threats.
      I have internship experience at Trend Micro, Nokia, and the Canadian Federal Government.
      These internships have enabled me to explore my interests while helping to make organizational impact.
      <br>
      
      <br>Aside from work, I'm interested in photography, dance, skiing, research, and sailing.
